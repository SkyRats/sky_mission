# IMAV2023Outdoor
Repository to add codes for the Outdoor phase of IMAV2023.
The competition consisted of 5 phases. The team reached fifth place, completing phases 1, 2 and 4. Due to time and logistics limitations, phases 3 and 5 were not carried out on the day of the competition. Phase 5, however, was extensively tested by the team and its documentation is present in the repository. In turn, phase 3 was made impossible by telemetry interference. We had to communicate with the drone from a distance of 120 meters, which proved impossible at the time.
