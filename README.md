# sky_mission

This repository holds all of the mission scripts Skyrats develops, both for internal projects and competitions. The main branch is supposed to be **empty**, as each project should have their own exclusive branches.

In order to go to a different branch, or create your own, use the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout <branch-name-here>
```


This repository is meant to be a submodule of [sky_ws](https://github.com/SkyRats/sky_ws "Skyrats workspace repository"), head there for a full installation guide.
